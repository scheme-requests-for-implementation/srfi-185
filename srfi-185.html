<h1>Abstract</h1>
<p>
Scheme specifies mutable fixed-length strings.
<a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-118/srfi-118.html">SRFI 118</a>
adds two procedures, <code>string-append!</code> and
<code>string-replace!</code>, which allow the length of the string to change.
This SRFI provides two linear-update versions of these procedures:
that is, the implementation may change the string length or return a
new string instead.
In addition, two convenience macros are provided that make the
procedures somewhat easier to use.
 
</p><h1>Rationale</h1>
<p>
Historically Scheme has only supported fixed-length strings.
Schemes that support SRFI 118 or
<a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-140/srfi-140.html">SRFI 140</a>
provide fixed-length immutable strings and variable-length
mutable strings, as the usefulness of standard Scheme's fixed-length mutable strings is
limited: the main use is for a buffer to which one incrementally
adds more data.  So why not fold that functionality into the string API?
That is, why can't you add just data to the end of a string?
</p><p>
The difficulty is that only a few Scheme implementations provide such
strings, and therefore variable-length strings are inherently not portable.
This SRFI provides a useful compromise that takes advantage of
implementation-specific variable-length strings where they exist, and simulates
them where they do not.  Note that a native implementation may well
copy the underlying characters, and therefore is <i>not</i> necessarily
more efficient.</p>

<p>The procedures and the macros of this SRFI together provide an
approximation of the two SRFI 118 procedures.  Direct calls to
<code>string-append!</code> and <code>string-replace!</code> are
compatible between the two SRFIs provided that the first argument is
a valid place (see below).  But calls made using <code>apply</code>,
or where the first argument is not a place, are incompatible.  In
those cases, it is necessary to use the two procedures while
being sure to appropriately capture the result.</p> 

<p>In this SRFI the terms <i>linear</i> and <i>linear-update</i>
are used in the sense of
<a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-1/srfi-1.html#LinearUpdateProcedures">
SRFI 1</a>.
That is, they are allowed &mdash; but not required &mdash; to side-effect
their first argument in order to construct their results.  They use the
same <code>!</code> suffix as purely mutational procedures, because
they must be treated by the user as mutational whether they actually
mutate anything or not.
In other words, any references to <var>dst</var>
other than the result of these procedures
must be treated as "dead" and never referred to again.
This must be so, since you can't rely on the value passed to a
linear-update procedure after that procedure has been called.

<h1>Specification</h1>

<h2>Storage model</h2>

<p>Note: This section does not apply to implementations that do not support
variable-length strings.</p>

<p>In terms of the R[567]RS storage model for strings
as described in Section 3.4 of both R5RS and R7RS,
strings are modeled not as ordinary fixed-length strings, but as a mutable box
(see <a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-111/srfi-111.html">SRFI
111</a> for a discussion of boxes) that contains a fixed-length immutable string.
Thus a variable-length string, rather than having one location per
character as a fixed-length string does, or no locations at all as an
fixed-length immutable string (for example, a string literal) does, has
just a single location.  This does <i>not</i> mean that this is the
only correct way to implement variable-length strings, but it clarifies
reasoning about them.</p>

<p>In particular, a fixed-length string whose length is zero is in
effect immutable, as it contains no locations.  But a variable-length
string whose current length is zero is modeled as a box containing
an empty immutable string rather than simply a fixed-length string.
Thus it is possible to extend it with additional characters
by changing the location in the box.</p>

<h2>Procedures</h2>
<p>
This SRFI provides two new procedures.  The most frequently used is likely to be
<code>string-append-linear!</code>, while <code>string-replace-linear!</code>
handles the general case of replacement of a substring
with another string of possibly different length.</p>

<pre>(<b>string-append-linear!</b> <var>dst</var> <var>string-or-char</var> ...)
</pre>
<blockquote>
<p>
This procedure returns a string which extends <var>dst</var> by
appending each additional <var>string-or-char</var> (in order) to the end of <var>dst</var>.
A character argument and a string argument of length 1 are treated exactly the same way.
The result can either be <var>dst</var> itself or a newly allocated string.
</p><p>
<p>There is no requirement that this procedure execute in constant time,
even amortised (i.e. average) constant time.
</p>
</blockquote>
<pre>(<b>string-replace-linear!</b> <var>dst</var> <var>dst-start</var> <var>dst-end</var> <var>src</var> [<var>src-start</var> [<var>src-end</var>]])
</pre>
<blockquote>
Returns a string which has the same characters as <var>dst</var>,
except that the characters between
<var>dst-start</var> and <var>dst-end</var> have been replaced
with the characters of the string
<var>src</var> between <var>src-start</var> and <var>src-end</var>.
The result can either be <var>dst</var> itself or a newly allocated string.
<p>
The number of characters from <var>src</var> may be different than the
number replaced in <var>dst</var>, so the result may be larger or smaller
than the previous length of <var>dst</var>.
The special case where <var>dst-start</var> is equal to <var>dst-end</var>
corresponds to insertion; the case where <var>src-start</var> is equal
to <var>src-end</var> corresponds to deletion.
The order in which characters are copied is unspecified,
except that if the source and destination overlap, copying takes
place as if the source is first copied into a temporary string and
then into the destination. (This can be achieved without allocating
storage by making sure to copy in the correct direction in such circumstances.)
<p>
When <var>src</var> is a string then
<code>(string-append-linear! <var>dst</var> <var>src</var>)</code> is equivalent to
<code>(string-replace-linear! <var>dst</var> (string-length <var>dst</var>) (string-length <var>dst</var>) <var>src</var>)</code>.
<p>
<em>Note:</em>
<a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-13/srfi-13.html">SRFI 13</a>
and its successors have
a non-destructive version, <code>string-replace</code>, which
takes the arguments in the following order:

<pre>
  (string-replace <var>dst</var> <var>src</var> <var>dst-start</var> <var>dst-end</var> [<var>src-start</var> [<var>src-end</var>]])
</pre>

We adopt a different argument order here to be consistent with
<code>string-copy!</code>, and with existing <code>string-replace!</code>
implementations.
</blockquote>
<h2>Macros</h2>
<p>
This SRFI also provides two new convenience macros.
The two macros are more or less equivalent to the procedures, except that the
first argument must be a <i>place</i>.  A place is either a variable
or a procedure application that is defined by
<code>identifier-syntax</code> or SRFI 17
so that it can appear as the first argument of <code>set!</code>.  An
implementation of these macros is free to evaluate the <i>place</i>
either once or twice, so it is an error for the place expression to
have either side-effects or non-trivial computation.

</p><pre>(<b>string-append!</b> <var>place</var> <var>string-or-char</var> ...)
</pre>
<blockquote>
<p>
This macro sets <i>place</i> to the result of invoking
<code>(string-append-linear! <i>place</i> <i>string-or-char</i> ...)</code>.
It returns an unspecified value.
</p><p>
</blockquote>
<pre>(<b>string-replace!</b> <var>dst-place</var> <var>dst-start</var> <var>dst-end</var> <var>src</var> [<var>src-start</var> [<var>src-end</var>]])
</pre>
<blockquote>
This macro sets <var>dst-place</var> to the result of applying
<code>string-replace-linear!</code> to its arguments.
The result is an unspecified value.
</blockquote>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>
The following example shows how to process a string using
<code>string-for-each</code> and incrementally <q>building</q> a result string
using the <code>string-append!</code> macro:</p>
<pre>(define (translate-space-to-newline str)
  (let ((result (make-string 0)))
    (string-for-each
     (lambda (ch)
       (cond ((char=? ch #\space)
              (string-append! result #\newline))
             ((char=? ch #\return)) ; Ignore
             (else
              (string-append! result ch))))
     str)
    result))
</pre>
<p><em>Usage note:</em> Compare with using string ports:</p>
<pre>(define (translate-space-to-newline str)
  (let ((out (open-output-string)))
    (string-for-each
     (lambda (ch)
       (cond ((char=? ch #\space)
              (write-char #\newline out))
             ((char=? ch #\return)) ; Ignore
             (else
              (write-char ch out))))
     str)
    (get-output-string out)))
</pre>
<p>Using a string port in this situation is probably preferable:
It is more portable, and you can expect decent performance in most
implementations.  Using <code>string-append!</code> may be slightly
more efficient on some implementations, due to lower overhead,
but that depends on the strategy used by <code>string-append!</code>
when the allocated buffer is too small.
The <code>string-append-linear!</code> and <code>string-append!</code> macro
are most useful when
using (reading) a string is interleaved with growing it,
or when also using <code>string-replace-linear!</code>
or <code>string-replace!</code>.
</blockquote>

<h1>Implementation</h1>
<p>Here is a portable implementation that always returns a new string.
It should not be
used on systems that provide native variable-length strings.
It depends on having
<a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-13/srfi-13.html">SRFI 13</a>,
<a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-130/srfi-130.html">SRFI 130</a>,
or <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-152/srfi-152.html">SRFI 152</a>.
Alternatively, implementers can copy the definition of <code>string-replace</code>
out of any of the sample implementations of those SRFIs.
</p>
<pre>
(define (string-append-linear! . args)
  (apply string-append
    (map (lambda (x) (if (char? x) (string x) x)) args)))
  
(define string-replace-linear!
  (case-lambda
    ((dst dst-start dst-end src)
     (string-replace dst src dst-start dst-end 0 (string-length src)))
    ((dst dst-start dst-end src src-start)
     (string-replace dst src dst-start dst-end src-start (string-length src)))
    ((dst dst-start dst-end src src-start src-end)
     (string-replace dst src dst-start dst-end src-start src-end))))
</pre>


<p>If <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-118/srfi-118.html">SRFI 118</a>
or <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-140/srfi-140.html">SRFI 140</a> is available,
the implementation is even more trivial:
</p>

<pre>
(define string-append-linear! srfi-118:string-append!)

(define string-replace-linear! srfi-118:string-replace!)
</pre>

<p>Finally, here are the macros:

<pre>
(define-syntax string-append!
  (syntax-rules ()
    ((_ place . args)
     (set! place (string-append-linear! place . args)))))

(define-syntax string-replace!
  (syntax-rules ()
    ((_ place . args)
     (set! place (string-replace-linear! place . args)))))
</pre>
<p>
A native implementation is easy, assuming there is some indirection
between the string object header and the actual stored characters.
(This is not true in all implementations, Chicken for example.)
Whenever the character buffer is full, it needs to be replaced with
a bigger buffer.  If the length of the new buffer is a
fixed multiple of the length of the old buffer then
 <code>string-append-linear!</code> has amortized constant execution time.
(The multiple 1.5 <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1100311/what-is-the-ideal-growth-rate-for-a-dynamically-allocated-array">seems a good choice</a>.)
</p><p>
If you have cheap Smalltalk-style <code>becomes:</code> (which is admittedly
unlikely these days) then you can use that when you need to grow a string
beyond its allocated length.
Alternatively, a garbage collection can be invoked, which is
what Chicken does when it must expand the bytes used to represent a UTF-8
string as a result of replacing a character with another character
that requires more bytes.
